# Chrome Feature Flags

A Chrome extension for managing websites feature flags

## Usage

This is a Chrome extension for managing with a website hiiden features.

The target website must support this feature flag implementation in order to enable/disable some hidden features.

This plug-in simply set a cookie named `features` with the variables passed in the input box.
The `reset` button removes all the existing featured already stored in the cookie and set the `features` to `reset`.
The client website should ideally recognise this information and clean the `features` cookie whenever its value is set to `reset`.
